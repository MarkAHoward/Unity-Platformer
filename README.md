# Overview

This Unity game was made to learn the software and learn how to create games with it.  I took the time to look up some tutorials and documentation to create the project and had some fun while doing it.  I focused on understanding and using only what Unity gave me so I did not get confused over different assests or tools that might make things more difficult.
The game is a simple platformer.  You use a/w to move forward and back, space to jump, and Left Shift to do a super jump.  The code written for the player is written in C#.
